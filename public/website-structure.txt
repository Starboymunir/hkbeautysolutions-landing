Please follow guide to the perfect result achievement: 



1. Have a bold, problem-focused headline
Whenever someone visits your webpage, the first thing they would notice is the headline. 
Hence, you must keep your headline short and crisp yet catchy. Moreover, it should be in bold, with a large font, and directly address your users. 
If your headline is too long or vague, there is a high probability that visitors will exit your page at once. 
2. Describe the benefits of your product
Once you have got the attention of your visitors, mention why they need to buy your product. 
While it is important to include a product description and how to use it, it is also essential to mention why your product is the best. 
You should mention the advantages that your product has, why it is better than your competitors, and how consumers would benefit.
3. Use only high-quality graphics
On average, humans tend to respond to visual data 60,000 times faster than text. 
Thus, it is crucial to include some high-quality images on your product landing page. Also, ensure that you are using the right color scheme, which appeals to your potential customers but does not distract them from your product.
Prospective customers want to see what your product looks like and how to use it. Graphics are particularly beneficial if you have an online store since people cannot get their hands on the physical product till they purchase it. 
Moreover, long forms of text can actually dissuade visitors from buying your product, causing them to exit the website.
4. Add customer reviews and testimonials
Another important campaign strategy is to include social proof on your product landing page. Social proof consists of customer reviews and testimonials of your brand. You can either choose to mention quotes from your clients, videos, or both. 
Even if your product has not been launched yet, you can provide early access to social media influencers, friends, and colleagues and ask them to review it. 
This will build credibility around your brand, convincing visitors that your website and company are genuine.
5. Work hard on your call to action (CTA)
After you have convinced your visitors to make a purchase, it is time to take action. This is where the CTA buttons come in. 
A CTA is a link to all the information that a potential buyer needs to place an order. It does not just include the price but also information like product variations, estimated delivery time, date of arrival, payment methods, and so on. 
Ideally, you should include multiple CTA buttons on your product landing page. 
If you have more than one product, each should have its own CTA button.
These CTA tabs should direct visitors to the product itself.
Text on the CTAs and any popups that come with them should have information like product details, delivery estimate, price, answers to frequently asked questions, and so on. 
6. Lead generation form
A key aspect of a good product landing page is the lead generation form. A lead generation form helps your brand capture a large number of prospective clients. You can then send them discounts and promotional offers and keep them updated about any newly launched products or services. 
Moreover, you can also use the lead generation form to inform your prospects about any sale days, such as Black Friday sales. 
Thus, even if a prospect does not make a purchase right now, they may be convinced to do so at a later date. 
The lead generation form should be short and simple. It should only ask for basic information such as the customer’s name, email address, and phone number. 
7. Mobile friendly
Today, an increasing number of people prefer to browse on a mobile device than on a desktop or laptop. Hence, you should ensure that your product landing page is mobile-friendly. 
The webpage should be designed and optimized in such a way that it is responsive to smartphones. 
The product landing page should consist of the optimum font size and graphics so that customers don’t have to spend a lot of time adjusting the screen size.
Moreover, they should be able to access all parts of your website, including any sign-up links.
